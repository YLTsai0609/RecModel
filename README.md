# RecModel
Python and Cython implementation of state-of-the-art collaborative filtering models such as the SLIM model, neighborhood-based models, variational autoencoder for collaborative filtering or RecWalk. The models can be trained on scipy.sparse matrices and evaluated with the recall@n metric. The package is under construction, more user support will be added.
